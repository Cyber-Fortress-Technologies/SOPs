## Compliance Framework

Compliance throught CIS Benchmarks 

- Disable unused services: Identify and disable any unnecessary services or daemons running on the server to reduce the attack surface.

- Secure password policies: Enforce strong password policies, such as minimum length, complexity requirements, and regular password changes. Implement account lockouts after a certain number of failed login attempts.

- Disable the root account: Instead of using the root account for administrative tasks, utilize the sudo mechanism to grant administrative privileges to regular user accounts.

- Restrict user access and permissions: Assign users with the least privileges necessary to perform their tasks. Remove unnecessary privileges and regularly review user accounts.

- Configure firewall rules: Enable and configure a firewall (e.g., iptables or firewalld) to allow only necessary incoming and outgoing network connections.

- Apply system updates and patches: Regularly update the Linux server with the latest security patches and updates from the vendor to protect against known vulnerabilities.

- Enable auditing and logging: Configure system auditing to track security events and enable detailed logging to detect and investigate any potential security incidents.

- Secure network services: Disable or secure network services not required for server functionality. For example, if a service is not needed, such as FTP or Telnet, disable or replace it with more secure alternatives.

- Secure SSH configuration: Ensure that Secure Shell (SSH) is properly configured to use strong encryption, disable root login, and use key-based authentication instead of passwords.

- Implement file integrity monitoring: Set up file integrity monitoring tools to detect any unauthorized changes to critical system files.
