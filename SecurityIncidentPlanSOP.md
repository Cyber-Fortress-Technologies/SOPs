Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) - Security Incident Plan

Objective:
The objective of this Security Incident Plan is to outline the procedures and guidelines for effectively detecting, responding to, and mitigating security incidents within the cloud infrastructure. This SOP aims to ensure that Cyber Fortress Technologies maintains a robust incident response capability and minimizes the impact of any potential security breaches.

Scope:
This Security Incident Plan applies to all team members involved in the security monitoring and incident response processes within Cyber Fortress Technologies. It covers the entire cloud infrastructure of the client company, including the Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), servers, and associated resources.

Definitions:

Security Incident: Any event that potentially compromises the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the client's cloud infrastructure or data.
Incident Response Team: Designated individuals responsible for detecting, analyzing, and responding to security incidents.
Incident Detection and Monitoring Procedures:
4.1. Event Log Monitoring:
Implement real-time monitoring of event logs from key assets, including EC2 instances, using SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) tools.
Configure the SIEM solution to generate alerts for suspicious activities or known attack patterns.
Continuously review and analyze the generated alerts for potential security incidents.
4.2. Threat Intelligence Integration:

Integrate threat intelligence feeds into the SIEM solution to enhance the detection of known threat indicators and patterns.
Regularly update the threat intelligence feeds to stay current with emerging threats.
4.3. Vulnerability Scanning:

Conduct regular vulnerability scans of the cloud infrastructure using industry-standard scanning tools.
Analyze the results and prioritize vulnerabilities based on severity.
Take immediate action to remediate critical vulnerabilities.
Incident Response Procedures:
5.1. Incident Identification and Classification:
Upon detection of a security incident, assign a unique incident identifier and classify the incident based on its severity and impact.
Record the incident details in the incident management system.
5.2. Incident Analysis and Containment:

Assemble the Incident Response Team to conduct a thorough analysis of the incident.
Contain the incident by isolating affected resources, disabling compromised accounts, or taking other necessary steps to limit the incident's impact.
Collect and preserve evidence for further analysis or potential legal action.
5.3. Incident Mitigation and Recovery:

Develop a mitigation strategy to eliminate the root cause of the incident.
Apply necessary patches, updates, or configuration changes to prevent similar incidents in the future.
Restore affected resources to their normal operating state once the incident is successfully mitigated.
5.4. Incident Reporting and Documentation:

Prepare incident reports detailing the incident's timeline, impact, actions taken, and lessons learned.
Share incident reports with relevant stakeholders, including the client company, for transparency and ongoing improvement.
Testing Procedures:
6.1. Security Controls Testing:
Conduct periodic testing of security controls, including IAM accounts, network segmentation, server hardening, and data encryption.
Evaluate the effectiveness of these controls in protecting the cloud infrastructure.
Document testing procedures, expected outcomes, and any identified vulnerabilities or weaknesses.
6.2. Monitoring Solutions Testing:

Simulate attack scenarios, such as a targeted intrusion attempt or a malware outbreak, to trigger the monitoring solutions.
Document the expected events and responses from the monitoring tools, including alerts generated, incident identification, and containment actions.
Evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the monitoring solutions in detecting and responding to security incidents.
Diagram of Expected Events:

Training and Awareness:
Conduct regular training sessions and workshops for the Incident Response Team to ensure they are up-to-date with the latest security practices, incident response procedures, and emerging threats.
Foster a culture of security awareness and encourage all team members to report any suspicious activities or potential security incidents promptly.
Review and Improvement:
Regularly review and update this Security Incident Plan to incorporate lessons learned from security incidents, changes in the threat landscape, and evolving best practices.
Conduct periodic drills and tabletop exercises to validate the effectiveness of the incident response procedures and identify areas for improvement.
Approval and Distribution:
This Security Incident Plan is subject to review, approval, and distribution to all relevant stakeholders, including the client company, internal teams, and the Incident Response Team.
Document Control:
Maintain proper document control practices to ensure the versioning, distribution, and retention of this Security Incident Plan and associated documents.
Note: This SOP is intended as a general framework and should be tailored to the specific needs and requirements of the client company and the cloud infrastructure environment.
