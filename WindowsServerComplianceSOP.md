# Version
1.0

# Date
2023-05-18

# 1. Objective
- The objective of this SOP is to provide instructions on how to harden a Windows Server 2019 EC2 instance in accordance with the Cyber Fortress Technologies cyber security framework. Hardening a server means making it more secure by reducing the number of attack vectors.

# 2. Scope
- This SOP applies to all Windows Server 2019 EC2 instances that are used by Cyber Fortress Technologies.

# 3. Prerequisites
- A Windows Server 2019 EC2 instance
- Administrative access to the instance

# 4. Procedure
The following steps can be used to harden a Windows Server 2019 EC2 instance:

- Update the operating system and all installed software to the latest versions.
- Install the latest security patches.
- Disable unnecessary services.
- Change the default administrator password to a strong password.
- Enable strong passwords for all user accounts.
- Use a firewall to restrict incoming and outgoing traffic.
- Install a security information and event management (SIEM) solution to monitor the - - server for suspicious activity.
- Back up the server regularly.
# 5. Documentation
The following documentation should be maintained for each hardened Windows Server 2019 EC2 instance:

- A list of installed software and its versions
- A list of enabled services
- The administrator password
- The list of user accounts and their passwords
- The firewall configuration
- The SIEM configuration
- The backup schedule

# 6. Testing
The following steps can be used to test the hardening of a Windows Server 2019 EC2 instance:

- Try to access the server using a variety of methods, including remote desktop, SSH, and the web browser.
- Try to brute-force the administrator password.
- Try to exploit known vulnerabilities.
- Monitor the server for suspicious activity using the SIEM solution.

# 7. Maintenance
The following steps should be taken to maintain the hardening of a Windows Server 2019 EC2 instance:

- Regularly update the operating system and all installed software.
- Install the latest security patches.
- Reconfigure the firewall as needed.
- Monitor the server for suspicious activity.
- Back up the server regularly.

# 8. Troubleshooting
If you encounter any problems with hardening a Windows Server 2019 EC2 instance, the following steps can be taken to troubleshoot the issue:

- Check the documentation for the server to see if there are any known issues.
- Review the server logs for any errors or suspicious activity.
- Contact Microsoft or the server manufacturer for support.
