# Standard Operating Procedure
Hardening a Windows Server 2019 EC2 Instance for Compliance with Cyber Fortress Technologies Cyber Security Framework

## Version
1.0

## Date
2023-05-18

## 1. Objective
- The objective of this SOP is to provide instructions on how to harden a Windows Server 2019 EC2 instance in accordance with the Cyber Fortress Technologies cyber security framework. Hardening a server means making it more secure by reducing the number of attack vectors.

## 2. Scope
- This SOP applies to all Windows Server 2019 EC2 instances that are used by Cyber Fortress Technologies.

## 3. Prerequisites
- A Windows Server 2019 EC2 instance
- Administrative access to the instance

## 4. Procedure
The following steps can be used to harden a Windows Server 2019 EC2 instance:

- Update the operating system and all installed software to the latest versions.
- Install the latest security patches.
- Disable unnecessary services.
- Change the default administrator password to a strong password.
- Enable strong passwords for all user accounts.
- Use a firewall to restrict incoming and outgoing traffic.
- Install a security information and event management (SIEM) solution to monitor the - - server for suspicious activity.
- Back up the server regularly.

## 5. Documentation
The following documentation should be maintained for each hardened Windows Server 2019 EC2 instance:

- A list of installed software and its versions
- A list of enabled services
- The administrator password
- The list of user accounts and their passwords
- The firewall configuration
- The SIEM configuration
- The backup schedule

## 6. Testing
The following steps can be used to test the hardening of a Windows Server 2019 EC2 instance:

- Try to access the server using a variety of methods, including remote desktop, SSH, and the web browser.
- Try to brute-force the administrator password.
- Try to exploit known vulnerabilities.
- Monitor the server for suspicious activity using the SIEM solution.

## 7. Maintenance
The following steps should be taken to maintain the hardening of a Windows Server 2019 EC2 instance:

- Regularly update the operating system and all installed software.
- Install the latest security patches.
- Reconfigure the firewall as needed.
- Monitor the server for suspicious activity.
- Back up the server regularly.

## 8. Troubleshooting
If you encounter any problems with hardening a Windows Server 2019 EC2 instance, the following steps can be taken to troubleshoot the issue:

- Check the documentation for the server to see if there are any known issues.
- Review the server logs for any errors or suspicious activity.
- Contact Microsoft or the server manufacturer for support.

# 9. Conclusion
By following the steps in this SOP, you can harden a Windows Server 2019 EC2 instance and make it more secure in accordance with the Cyber Fortress Technologies cyber security framework.
# 10. Review and Revision
###  Policy and Procedure Review

a. Conduct periodic reviews of cyber security policies and procedures to ensure they remain up to date and aligned with industry best practices and regulatory requirements.

b. Establish a review schedule that specifies the frequency of policy and procedure reviews, taking into account changes in the threat landscape, technology advancements, and organizational changes.

c. Involve key stakeholders, such as IT, legal, compliance, and management, in the review process to gather diverse perspectives and expertise.

### Change Management

a. Implement a formal change management process for updating and revising cyber security policies and procedures.

b. Assign responsibility for change management, including the identification of necessary changes, impact assessments, approval, communication, and implementation.

c. Ensure that changes to policies and procedures undergo appropriate testing and validation before being implemented organization-wide.

### Version Control

a. Establish a version control system to manage revisions and updates to cyber security policies and procedures.

b. Maintain a clear record of version history, including the date of each revision, the reason for the change, and the individuals involved in the revision process.

c. Clearly indicate the most current version of policies and procedures to avoid confusion and ensure employees are accessing the latest information.

### Stakeholder Feedback

a. Encourage feedback from stakeholders, such as employees, managers, and subject matter experts, regarding the effectiveness and relevance of cyber security policies and procedures.

b. Provide a designated channel or mechanism for stakeholders to submit feedback, suggestions, or concerns.

c. Regularly review and consider stakeholder feedback during the policy and procedure review process, incorporating relevant suggestions for improvement.

### Continuous Improvement

a. Continuously monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of cyber security policies and procedures through ongoing feedback, incident trends, and emerging threats.

b. Identify areas for improvement and implement changes to enhance the organization's cyber security posture.

c. Stay updated on the latest industry standards, regulations, and best practices to ensure policies and procedures reflect current requirements and address emerging risks.
